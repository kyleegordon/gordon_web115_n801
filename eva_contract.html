      <h2>CPCC EVA Course Contract</h2>
      
      <p>I, <a href="" >Kylee N. Gordon</a> agree to abide by the terms in my Fall 2021 WEB115 - N801 course with my instructor, D.I. von Briesen.</p>
      
      <p>I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal websites will be publicly available to the world. I will not
      put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.</p>
      
      <p> I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in
      assignments may show as absences.</p>
